<h3>About the competition</h3>
          <p>
            <i>&lt;19 Shape your world!</i> is a creative competition motivating
            innovative digital solutions to everyday problems. Anyone, who is
            under 19 years old from Hungary or a Hungarian-speaking region can
            take part by submitting finished projects on this website by the
            29th of October 2024.

            The competition has been organised by the C<sup>3</sup> Foundation
            every year since 2003. The awarded works are evaluated by a
            professional jury made up of artists, coders, ex-winners and
            educators. Their final selection is based not on the skill-level of
            the contestant or the technological complexity of the submitted
            project, but on the idea behind. Chosen works are presented in an
            exhibition in Budapest, where the award-ceremony takes place
            alongside open, creative workshops for all age groups.

            A dedicated website is developed each year, making it possible to
            follow technological trends in the target age group (&lt;19)
            throughout the years. Please find the websites from previous years
            and information on winner projects here:
